           Hello! I'm Julian, a rising senior majoring in Computer Science at Virginia Tech. My main area of expertise is centered around full-stack engineering. I love the process of creating a complete product, from the database to the user interface. However, as of late, I've gained interest in software architecture and networking, which I'm looking forward to diving more into.

            Fun Fact: In my free time, you'll find me at the gym, catching up on a good show, or out for a long walk.
